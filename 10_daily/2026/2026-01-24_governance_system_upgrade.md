## Chat History

### User
> ok we have a lot of moving parts for my systems, operations, documentation, sites, apps, ect. and all of thos interact with one another or overlap and what happens is we end up with redudant and or contradictory standards, templates, metadata, duplicate functions, etc. we need some kind of map or inventory of the projects, tools, apps, purpose, function, protocol the why ect. to ensure when we add or remove or udpate something we understand the full consequences or avoid redoing or duplciating or adding contradictory items. how can we do this and make sure that my ide can reference it and easy for me to update as well considering my adhd.

### Assistant
> You’re not wrong—the problem is not “too many projects.”  
> The problem is **no single source of truth that governs the rest**. Everything is allowed to evolve independently, so drift is guaranteed.
> 
> What you need is **one governing map**, not more templates.
> 
> Below is the cleanest, lowest-overhead way to solve this *without creating another thing to maintain* and *with ADHD in mind*.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The Solution (Plain Truth)
> 
> You need a **System Registry + Dependency Graph** that is:
> 
> • **Authoritative** (everything else defers to it)  
> • **Machine-readable** (IDE + agents can reference it)  
> • **Human-scannable** (you can grok it in 60 seconds)  
> • **Low-friction to update** (no ceremony)
> 
> Not a wiki.  
> Not Notion pages everywhere.  
> Not diagrams you never update.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Core Concept
> 
> ### **One Canonical Registry**
> A **single folder** that defines:
> - What exists
> - Why it exists
> - What it depends on
> - What depends on it
> - What standards it must obey
> 
> Everything else references *this*, not each other.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Folder Placement (Important)
> 
> Put this at the **top of your universe**, not inside a project:
> 
> ```
> /QiRegistry/
> ```
> 
> This is the constitution.  
> Repos, apps, docs, sites are *citizens*, not lawmakers.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Registry Structure (Minimal, Scalable)
> 
> ```
> QiRegistry/
> ├─ README.md                 # How to use this system (1 page max)
> ├─ registry.yaml             # Master inventory (machine + human)
> ├─ standards/
> │  ├─ metadata.schema.yaml
> │  ├─ naming.schema.yaml
> │  ├─ doc.schema.yaml
> │  └─ api.contracts.yaml
> ├─ graphs/
> │  ├─ dependency.graph.json
> │  └─ impact.rules.yaml
> └─ tools/
>    ├─ validate_registry.py
>    ├─ impact_check.py
>    └─ ide_hint.json
> ```
> 
> This is it.  
> No bloat. No duplication.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The Master File: `registry.yaml`
> 
> This is the heart. Everything references this.
> 
> Example (simplified but real):
> 
> ```yaml
> projects:
>   QiOS:
>     type: platform
>     purpose: "Execution substrate for all local-first systems"
>     owns:
>       - runtime
>       - agents
>       - filesystem_ops
>     depends_on:
>       - QiNote
>     standards:
>       - metadata.schema
>       - api.contracts
>     status: active
> 
>   QiNote:
>     type: knowledge_system
>     purpose: "Canonical memory, documentation, and reasoning layer"
>     owns:
>       - notes
>       - embeddings
>       - schemas
>     depends_on: []
>     standards:
>       - metadata.schema
>       - naming.schema
>     status: active
> 
>   QiPortals:
>     type: app
>     purpose: "Client-facing portals"
>     depends_on:
>       - QiOS
>       - Zoho
>     overlaps_with:
>       - Websites
>     status: experimental
> ```
> 
> This alone solves **80% of your chaos**.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Why This Works (ADHD-Proof)
> 
> ### 1. **Single Edit Surface**
> You only update *one file* when:
> - Adding something
> - Deprecating something
> - Refactoring something
> 
> No hunting.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. **IDE-Readable**
> Your IDE can:
> - Load `registry.yaml`
> - Warn when you create:
>   - Duplicate functionality
>   - Conflicting standards
>   - Circular dependencies
> 
> You can even make Cursor or Copilot **ask questions** based on it:
> > “This feature already exists in QiOS. Are you extending or duplicating?”
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. **Impact Awareness**
> Before changing anything, you run:
> 
> ```
> impact_check.py QiNote
> ```
> 
> And it tells you:
> - What breaks
> - What needs updating
> - What standards apply
> 
> No surprises. No “oh shit” moments later.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. **Standards Are Abstracted**
> Standards live once:
> 
> ```
> standards/metadata.schema.yaml
> ```
> 
> Projects **reference**, not copy.
> 
> No more:
> - Conflicting front matter
> - Slightly different schemas
> - “Which version is correct?”
> 
> There is one.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Dependency Graph (Optional but Powerful)
> 
> Auto-generated from `registry.yaml`:
> 
> ```
> QiNote → QiOS → QiPortals
>          ↓
>       Websites
> ```
> 
> This lets you visually see:
> - Blast radius
> - Redundancy
> - Hidden coupling
> 
> You do **not** manually maintain this.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## How This Prevents Redundancy
> 
> Before you build anything new, you answer **five questions**:
> 
> 1. Does it already exist?
> 2. Who owns this responsibility?
> 3. Is this a new system or an extension?
> 4. What standards apply automatically?
> 5. What breaks if I change it?
> 
> The registry answers all five instantly.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
> 
> These keep the system sane:
> 
> 1. **No project may define its own standards**
> 2. **No tool exists unless it’s in `registry.yaml`**
> 3. **If it overlaps, it must declare overlap**
> 4. **If it depends, it must declare dependency**
> 5. **Registry updates happen before implementation**
> 
> If you violate these, drift returns.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The Uncomfortable Truth
> 
> You don’t need more documentation.  
> You need **governance**.
> 
> This is lightweight governance that:
> - Doesn’t slow you down
> - Makes agents smarter
> - Keeps your future self sane
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Next Move (Concrete)
> 
> If you want, I’ll do one of these next—your call:
> 
> 1. Draft **your actual `registry.yaml`** from everything you already have  
> 2. Design the **metadata.schema.yaml** once and kill all variants  
> 3. Create the **impact_check.py** logic  
> 4. Build IDE hints so Cursor actively warns you
> 
> Pick **one**.

### Assistant
> Yes. You already built 70% of the governance system. The issue isn’t “we don’t have it.” The issue is **it’s fragmented into multiple registries and un-enforced standards**, so contradictions can still sneak in.
> 
> What you have is an *admin library*. What you still need is an *authoritative system of record with enforcement + impact analysis*.
> 
> Here’s how to convert what you already have into the thing you described—without starting over.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## What you have (and what it’s missing)
> 
> ### You already have:
> - ADRs (decisions) ✅
> - Doctrine (philosophy/placement) ✅
> - Protocols (policies/standards) ✅
> - Registries (inventories) ✅
> - Scripts + templates ✅
> 
> ### Missing (the reason drift still happens):
> 1. **One canonical “system inventory” file** (single pane of glass)
> 2. **A schema** that makes registries consistent and machine-checkable
> 3. **Validation + linting** (CI / pre-commit) so standards aren’t optional
> 4. **Impact graph** (what breaks if X changes)
> 5. **IDE/agent entrypoint** so Cursor/IDE can reference it reliably
> 
> ---
> 
> ## The upgrade path (no rewrite)
> 
> ### Step 1 — Declare a single canonical registry
> Right now you have multiple registries:
> 
> - clients_registry.json
> - domains_registry.json
> - ids_registry.json
> - systems_registry.json
> - workflows_registry.json
> - stack.json
> - tools.json
> 
> That’s fine, but you need **one canonical index** that ties them together and resolves “where truth lives.”
> 
> Create:
> 
> `_qios_admin/registries/registry_index.yaml`
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```yaml
> version: 1
> canonical:
>   systems: registries/systems_registry.json
>   workflows: registries/workflows_registry.json
>   domains: registries/domains_registry.json
>   clients: registries/clients_registry.json
>   ids: registries/ids_registry.json
>   stack: stack.json
>   tools: tools.json
> 
> authoritative_rules:
>   - "If a system is not in systems_registry, it does not exist."
>   - "If an ADR contradicts doctrine, ADR wins only if it references the doctrine section it overrides."
>   - "IDs must be registered in ids_registry before use."
> ```
> 
> This becomes the **single entrypoint** for IDE + agents + you.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Step 2 — Normalize registries with a shared schema
> Right now “systems_registry.json” and “tools.json” can drift in shape.
> 
> Add:
> 
> `_qios_admin/registries/schemas/`
> 
> - `system.schema.json`
> - `workflow.schema.json`
> - `domain.schema.json`
> - `tool.schema.json`
> 
> Then every registry references a schema and can be validated.
> 
> This is what prevents “almost the same field names” and metadata contradictions.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Step 3 — Add impact fields (your missing “consequences” layer)
> Your systems registry needs explicit dependency edges. Minimal fields:
> 
> - `depends_on` (upstream)
> - `provides` (capabilities)
> - `overlaps_with` (known redundancy zones)
> - `owners` (human/system responsible)
> - `interfaces` (APIs/contracts or “how other things touch it”)
> 
> Example entry in `systems_registry.json`:
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "id": "SYS_QINOTE",
>   "name": "QiNote",
>   "type": "knowledge_system",
>   "purpose": "Canonical documentation + memory layer",
>   "depends_on": [],
>   "provides": ["docs", "schemas", "ids", "embeddings"],
>   "overlaps_with": ["Notion"],
>   "interfaces": ["paperless_ingest", "gina_rag_contract"],
>   "status": "active"
> }
> ```
> 
> This is what lets you compute “blast radius.”
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Step 4 — Generate the graph automatically (no manual diagrams)
> Add one script:
> 
> `_qios_admin/scripts/QiImpact.py`
> 
> Outputs:
> 
> - `_qios_admin/graphs/dependency_graph.json`
> - `_qios_admin/graphs/dependency_graph.md` (human readable)
> 
> So when you change a system you can run:
> 
> `python QiImpact.py --system SYS_QINOTE`
> 
> And it prints:
> 
> - dependents (downstream)
> - dependencies (upstream)
> - overlaps (possible duplication)
> - standards affected
> 
> This is the “don’t redo work / don’t contradict” engine.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Step 5 — Make it enforceable (otherwise it’s just vibes)
> Add pre-commit + CI checks:
> 
> - Validate registries against schemas
> - Ensure all ADRs referenced systems exist in registry
> - Ensure no orphan tools exist outside tools.json
> - Ensure naming standards are met
> 
> Hook it through your existing `Setup-QiHooks.ps1`.
> 
> Result: contradictions become *errors*, not future headaches.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Step 6 — IDE reference (so Cursor can “see the truth”)
> Add a single “IDE entry doc”:
> 
> `_qios_admin/README_IDE.md`
> 
> Contains:
> - what the canonical registry index is
> - how to resolve truth
> - how to run impact checks
> - how to add a new system properly
> 
> Then you point Cursor to it (or include it in your agent system prompt).
> 
> ---
> 
> # The punchline
> 
> You don’t need a new “map.”  
> You need to **promote your existing registries into a governed, validated, graph-generating source of truth**.
> 
> You already have the admin architecture. The missing ingredient is:
> 
> **canonical index + schemas + dependency fields + impact generator + enforcement hooks.**
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Do this next (one clean move)
> If you want maximum momentum: implement **registry_index.yaml + dependency fields** first.
> 
> Because once dependency fields exist, the graph and impact tooling becomes trivial.
> 
> If you paste your current `systems_registry.json` (even if messy), I’ll:
> - normalize the structure,
> - add the minimal dependency/overlap fields,
> - and give you a clean “v1 schema” you can enforce immediately.

### Assistant
> Good. This is exactly the evidence we needed: you already have the “constitution” (stack + rules) **and** you have inventories—but they’re currently **duplicating each other with different authority levels**, which is how drift starts.
> 
> Right now you have three overlapping truth-claims:
> 
> - `stack.json` = “authoritative layers + governance rules” (this should be the constitution)
> - `tools.json` = “inventory; stack.json is authoritative” (good)
> - `systems_registry.json` = a second, weaker inventory **with different fields** (this is where contradictions will breed)
> 
> So the move is not “create a new system.” The move is:
> 
> ## Make the stack the constitution, make the registries normalized views, enforce it
> 
> ### The corrective architecture
> - **stack.json** = *constitution* (principles, authoritative layers, governance rules, integration policy)
> - **tools.json** = *inventory of tools* (what exists, category, criticality, role)
> - **systems_registry.json** = *inventory of systems* (systems are not the same as tools; they can be composites)
> - **workflows_registry.json** = *inventory of workflows* (n8n + specs + exports + dependencies)
> - **registry_index.yaml** = *single entrypoint* so IDE/agents know where truth lives
> 
> Right now, your `systems_registry.json` is basically a partial re-listing of tools. Either:
> - kill it, or
> - redefine “system” properly so it’s not “tool again.”
> 
> I recommend redefining it, because “QiOS” is a *system* composed of multiple tools.
> 
> ---
> 
> # 1) What to change immediately (minimal, high impact)
> 
> ## A. Add the canonical index
> Create: `_qios_admin/registries/registry_index.yaml`
> 
> ```yaml
> version: 1
> authoritative:
>   constitution: ../stack.json
> 
> registries:
>   tools: tools_registry.json
>   systems: systems_registry.json
>   workflows: workflows_registry.json
>   domains: domains_registry.json
>   clients: clients_registry.json
>   ids: ids_registry.json
> 
> rules:
>   - "stack.json is the constitution and is always authoritative."
>   - "tools_registry is an inventory; tools must map to a stack layer."
>   - "systems_registry defines composites/capabilities and may reference tools."
>   - "workflows_registry is the only place workflows exist, each must link to a spec + export."
> ```
> 
> This becomes the file your IDE/agents always open first.
> 
> ## B. Rename `tools.json` to `tools_registry.json`
> Because “tools.json” sounds authoritative. It’s not. It’s an inventory registry.
> 
> Same content, just rename.
> 
> ## C. Fix the duplication: Systems ≠ Tools
> Your current `systems_registry.json` is listing tools with role/hosting. That’s redundant with tools inventory. Reframe it as **systems as composites + capabilities**.
> 
> ---
> 
> # 2) Define “System” vs “Tool” (so your brain stops melting)
> 
> ### Tool
> A vendor/product/runtime: n8n, Railway, Postgres, Zoho One, Cloudflare Access.
> 
> ### System
> A named capability boundary you own conceptually:
> - **QiOS Orchestration Spine** (n8n + Postgres + Railway)
> - **QiPortals Delivery System** (Cloudflare Pages + Supabase + GitHub)
> - **Document Intake System** (Paperless-ngx + chunker/embedder + storage)
> 
> This distinction is what prevents: “Is Zoho One the system or is QiOps the system?”
> 
> ---
> 
> # 3) Your stacks/tools are good, but there are two hard issues
> 
> ## Issue 1: “PostgreSQL” appears as both a layer tool and a tool entry
> That’s fine, but you need a stable identifier to avoid string drift (Postgres vs PostgreSQL).
> 
> **Fix:** introduce IDs and reference by ID.
> 
> Example:
> - Tool ID: `TOOL_POSTGRES`
> - Tool ID: `TOOL_N8N`
> - System ID: `SYS_ORCH_SPINE`
> 
> ## Issue 2: “Systems Registry” currently cannot support impact analysis
> It has no `depends_on`, no `provides`, no `interfaces`, no `owners`.
> 
> So it can’t answer your original question: “what happens if I change X?”
> 
> ---
> 
> # 4) Concrete normalized schemas (small, strict)

### Assistant
> Good. That schema is the right direction. Two problems:
> 
> 1) It’s currently mixing **“system as a tool”** (hosting) with **“system as a composite”** (depends/provides/interfaces).  
> 2) Your `type` enum is really **stack layers**, not “system type” in the broader sense.
> 
> Fix those two and you have a clean foundation that can actually drive validation + impact analysis.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## What I would change in your schema (surgically)
> 
> ### 1) Add `composed_of_tools` (this is the missing bridge)
> If systems are composites, you need a first-class link to tool IDs.
> 
> ### 2) Make `type` either:
> - `layer` (maps to your stack’s authoritative layers), or
> - expand `type` to include composite categories.
> 
> Given your stack.json already defines layers, the cleanest approach is:
> 
> - Keep `type` but rename it to `layer`
> - Optionally add `system_class` if you later want “composite vs single-tool system”
> 
> ### 3) Add `criticality` (or you’ll never triage properly)
> You already do this for tools. Systems need it too.
> 
> ### 4) Tighten dependency typing
> `depends_on` should reference **SYS_ IDs** only.
> 
> ### 5) Hosting should not be a single string (because composites span vendors)
> Make it optional or computed from tools. If you keep it, make it a structured object.

> 
> ---
> 
> ## What to do next (no deliberation)
> 
> You already have enough artifacts to proceed. Here’s the tight execution order:
> 
> 1) Create `registry_index.yaml`
> 2) Rename `tools.json` → `tools_registry.json` and add `TOOL_` IDs
> 3) Rewrite `systems_registry.json` entries to match this schema (composites)
> 4) Add a validator script that checks:
>    - system/tool IDs exist
>    - dependencies are valid
>    - layers match stack.json
>    - no orphan systems or tools
> 5) Only then build the impact graph generator
> 
> If you want, paste your current `tools.json` and the current `systems_registry.json` content (even rough). I will return:
> - a fully normalized `tools_registry.json` with `TOOL_` IDs,
> - a redefined `systems_registry.json` using your schema,
> - and a matching `tool.schema.json` so validation can begin immediately.

### Assistant
> Yes—this is structurally right. You’ve turned `_qios_admin` into a real governance package: constitution (`stack.json`), laws (protocols), court opinions (ADRs), inventories (registries), and enforcement (lint + hooks). That’s the correct shape.
> 
> Now the “make it actually work” tweaks. A few surgical changes will prevent future drift and make this IDE/ADHD-friendly.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## What’s right (keep as-is)
> - `README.md` + `README_IDE.md` at root: correct.
> - `decisions/` + `doctrine/` + `protocols/`: clean separation.
> - `registries/` with `schemas/`: exactly what you want.
> - `scripts/` containing `QiImpact.py` + `QiLint.py` + hooks: perfect.
> - `graphs/` for generated artifacts: correct.
> - `templates/`: fine.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Fixes I would make (small, important)
> 
> ### 1) Put generated outputs in an explicit `_generated/` folder
> Right now `graphs/` is fine, but `lint.txt` and `lint_output.txt` sitting at root will become junk-drawer creep.
> 
> Change to:
> 
> ```
> _generated/
>   graphs/
>     dependency_graph.md
>     dependency_graph.json
>   lint/
>     lint_output.txt
>     lint_report.json
> ```
> 
> Then your root stays clean and the “what’s authoritative vs generated” line stays crisp.
> 
> ### 2) Add missing schemas now (or your registries won’t stay normalized)
> You have:
> - `system.schema.json`
> - `tool.schema.json`
> 
> You also need (minimum):
> - `workflow.schema.json`
> - `registry_index.schema.json` (optional but helpful)
> 
> Otherwise workflows become the next wildcard.
> 
> ### 3) Add `workflows_registry.json` schema enforcement + export pointers
> Your governance rules require “export artifact + Markdown spec.” That needs to be enforced by schema.
> 
> So `workflow.schema.json` should require:
> - `id`
> - `name`
> - `status`
> - `authoritative_executor` (TOOL_N8N)
> - `spec_md`
> - `export_artifact`
> - `depends_on_tools` and/or `depends_on_systems`
> - `criticality`
> 
> ### 4) Decide what “graphs” are: source or derived
> If `dependency_graph.md` is derived from registries, it should be treated as generated and *never hand-edited*.
> 
> So:
> - Put it under `_generated/graphs/`
> - Add a note in `README_IDE.md`: “Do not edit; run QiImpact.py”
> 
> ### 5) Add a “contracts/” folder now, even if empty
> You have `interfaces` in the system schema. Those references need a home.
> 
> Add:
> 
> ```
> contracts/
>   rag_contracts/
>   api/
>   webhooks/
> ```
> 
> Even if it’s empty today, this prevents “interfaces” from pointing to random places later.
> 
> ### 6) Tighten registry folder order (minor, but helps your brain)
> Put “index + schemas” first, then registries:
> 
> ```
> registries/
>   registry_index.yaml
>   schemas/
>   tools_registry.json
>   systems_registry.json
>   workflows_registry.json
>   ids_registry.json
>   domains_registry.json
>   clients_registry.json
> ```
> 
> This matches “entrypoint → rules → data.”
> 
> ---
> 
> ## One thing that’s *not* right yet (and will bite you)
> 
> You still have **both**:
> - `stack.json` defining authoritative layers/tools
> - `tools_registry.json` listing tools
> 
> That’s fine, but you need one explicit rule:
> 
> **Tools registry cannot contradict stack.json.**  
> If stack says orchestration tool is n8n, tools registry can list n8n, but cannot declare a different “spine orchestration” tool.
> 
> This is enforced by `QiLint.py`:
> - check every `authoritative_layers.*.tool/tooling` exists in `tools_registry`
> - check those tools have `criticality: spine`
> - check their `stack_layer` matches the layer name
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Your final “gold” version (recommended tree)
> 
> I’d adjust your tree to this:

> If you can do these three commands and always get consistent output, your system is “real”:
>

> 2) `python _qios_admin/scripts/QiImpact.py --write`
> 3) `git status` shows only `_generated/` changed (plus whatever you intentionally edited)
> 
> That’s governance that stays alive.

> If you paste your current `registry_index.yaml` and one of your registry files (tools or systems), I’ll tell you immediately whether your schemas and lint rules will actually validate cleanly, and what fields you’re missing.

### Assistant
> Yep — **this is the right direction and it’s now “governance-grade.”** You fixed the biggest failure mode (generated junk + contracts sprawl) and the registries/schemas are finally in the right places.
> 
> Now the *sharp edges* I see (stuff that will quietly re-introduce drift if you don’t correct it).
> 
> ---
> 
> ## ✅ What’s correct
> 
> ### 1) You separated “source” vs “derived”
> Putting lint + graphs under `_generated/` is correct. That preserves authority boundaries.
> 
> ### 2) Your schemas are legit
> - `system.schema.json` is strong: required core fields, strict IDs, `additionalProperties:false`, layers include your “media_processing” extension, and the SYS/TOOL ID patterns are right. fileciteturn0file0  
> - `tool.schema.json` is clean and strict enough for tool inventory validation. fileciteturn0file1  
> - `workflow.schema.json` enforces the minimum structure and allows optional fields for the spec/export artifacts. fileciteturn0file2  
> 
> ### 3) Your registries are already in the correct “constitutional” relationship
> - Systems reference tools via IDs (`composed_of_tools`). fileciteturn0file5  
> - Workflows reference system + authoritative executor (`TOOL_N8N`). fileciteturn0file4  
> - Tools have stable IDs, criticality, and stack_layer. fileciteturn0file3  
> 
> This is the backbone for impact analysis and “don’t duplicate shit.”
> 
> ---
> 
> ## ⚠️ What needs fixing (real problems)
> 
> ### 1) You have **index.html everywhere**
> Right now every folder has an `index.html`. That’s fine **only if** you’re intentionally publishing `_qios_admin` as a browsable static site (docs portal). If not, it’s noise and creates accidental “source files” that don’t belong in governance.
> 
> **Rule:**  
> - If `_qios_admin` is a site → keep index.html *only in one place* (root), and generate the rest into `_generated/site/`.  
> - If it’s not a site → delete all `index.html` and keep it Markdown/JSON/YAML only.
> 
> Otherwise you’ll eventually edit an HTML file by accident and think you updated governance.
> 
> ### 2) Two ADR filenames are broken: `...md.md`
> You’ve got:
> - `2026-01-26_adr_crm_first_execution_model.md.md`
> - `2026-01-26_adr_model_a_qiservices_products_manual_checklists.md.md`
> 
> That’s a classic “tiny inconsistency becomes chaos later” thing. Fix the names now.
> 
> ### 3) Your *layer vocabulary* is inconsistent across tools/systems/stack
> Systems schema layers include: `orchestration`, `operational_memory`, `edge_and_security`, `business_apps`, `platform_services`, `static_delivery`, `knowledge_system`, `media_processing`. fileciteturn0file0
> 
> But your tools registry has stack_layer values like:
> - `infrastructure`
> - `vendor_automation` fileciteturn0file3
> 
> Those are not in the system-layer enum, and unless `stack.json` formally recognizes them, your lint/impact logic will become “optional” (aka useless).
> 
> **Fix options (pick one and standardize):**
> - **Option A (clean):** tools `stack_layer` must be one of the canonical layers (same enum as systems). Replace `infrastructure` with whichever layer it truly supports (often `orchestration` / `operational_memory` / `static_delivery`), and treat “vendor_automation” as a `category` not a layer.
> - **Option B (ok):** explicitly allow “extensions” in registry_index + lint (e.g., `infrastructure`, `vendor_automation`) and treat them as non-authoritative labels.
> 
> If you don’t do this, QiLint will either:
> - false-positive constantly, or
> - get watered down until it checks nothing.
> 
> ### 4) Your workflow registry is using a template as a spec
> `spec_md: "protocols/flow_spec_template.md"` in workflows registry is a smell. fileciteturn0file4
> 
> A template isn’t a spec. That will turn into “we technically comply” while nothing is actually documented.
> 
> **Fix:** create a real specs folder and point workflows at real specs.
> 
> Recommended:
> 
> ```
> _qios_admin/workflows/
>   specs/
>     WF_QIOS_0001.md
>   exports/
>     n8n/
>       WF_QIOS_0001.json
> ```
> 
> Then `spec_md` points to `workflows/specs/WF_QIOS_0001.md`.
> 
> ### 5) Your systems registry is good — but you’re missing overlaps and contracts
> You’re already using `interfaces` like `"webhooks"`, `"postgres_queries"`, etc. fileciteturn0file5  
> That’s fine as “tags,” but your *contracts folder* exists now, so you should start anchoring interfaces to real contract IDs or files.
> 
> Example pattern:
> - `interfaces`: `["contract:webhooks:ingress-v1", "contract:postgres:opslog-v1"]`
> - then store them under `contracts/webhooks/ingress-v1.md`, etc.
> 
> This is what makes IDE referencing real.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## 🔧 Minimum “make it enforceable” rules for QiLint
> 
> Your QiLint should enforce:
> 
> 1) **Every SYS_* references only existing TOOL_* in composed_of_tools**  
> 2) **Every workflow references existing SYS_* and TOOL_* executor**  
> 3) **Every SYS layer must be in the canonical layer list** (schema already covers that) fileciteturn0file0  
> 4) **Every TOOL stack_layer must be in canonical layers OR explicit extensions** (decide A or B above) fileciteturn0file3  
> 5) **If workflow status is active/important/spine → require spec_md + export_artifact exists** (schema doesn’t enforce file existence; QiLint must)
> 
> That last one is key: schemas validate structure, lint validates reality.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## Verdict on your tree
> 
> **Yes, it’s right.** It’s now a proper admin “constitution package.”
> 
> But do these 5 cleanups to prevent future rot:
> 1) Decide what `index.html` means (site vs noise) and stop spraying them everywhere.
> 2) Fix the `.md.md` ADR names.
> 3) Normalize `stack_layer` vocabulary (tools) to match canonical layers or explicitly declare extensions.
> 4) Stop pointing workflows at templates—create real workflow specs/exports folders.
> 5) Start anchoring `interfaces` to actual contract files/IDs.
> 
> ---
> 
> If you paste your `registry_index.yaml` and `stack.json`, I’ll tell you *exactly* which layer strings are currently canonical, which are “extensions,” and what your QiLint should treat as valid vs invalid so the IDE can trust it.

### User
> is there anythign in this chat that we should use in the udpate qiaccess and qinexus

### Assistant
> Yes. Use this chat to update **QiAccess/QiNexus governance**, not just `_qios_admin`.
> 
> Add these decisions:
> 
> 1. **QiAccess becomes the front-door / navigation layer**
>    - It should point to `_qios_admin`, registries, generated graphs, lint reports, contracts, workflow specs, and docs.
>    - It should not duplicate governance content.
>    - It should surface “what exists / status / where to go.”
> 
> 2. **QiNexus becomes the storage layer**
>    - Holds assets, docs, exports, datasets, evidence, templates, archives.
>    - It should reference `_qios_admin` standards but not redefine them.
>    - No duplicate naming/metadata rules inside QiNexus unless inherited from admin.
> 
> 3. **_qios_admin is the governance source of truth**
>    - `stack.json` = constitution.
>    - `registries/` = inventory.
>    - `schemas/` = validation rules.
>    - `contracts/` = integration/API/RAG/webhook boundaries.
>    - `_generated/` = derived outputs only.
> 
> 4. **Add QiAccess pages/cards for**
>    - Systems Registry
>    - Tools Registry
>    - Workflows Registry
>    - Dependency Graph
>    - Lint Report
>    - Contracts
>    - ADRs / Decisions
>    - Protocols
>    - QiNexus Map
> 
> 5. **Add this rule to QiNexus**
>    - “If a folder, tool, workflow, schema, or protocol affects multiple systems, it belongs in `_qios_admin` and QiNexus only stores related artifacts/outputs.”
> 
> 6. **Add this rule to QiAccess**
>    - “QiAccess displays and links governance; it does not create competing standards.”
> 
> The biggest update: **QiAccess = dashboard. QiNexus = storage. _qios_admin = authority.**
> 
> That’s the clean separation.
