# QiCapture

## Overview

QiCapture is the data intake and ingestion pipeline of QiOS. It handles messy life data (exports, receipts, documents) and turns it into clean, structured, and searchable materials.

## Responsibilities

- Clean and parse raw intake.
- Index and extract metadata from documents (via OCR or scripts).
- Chunk and embed clean text for semantic search.
- Form entity relationships and graphs from text.
- Synchronize indices and manage backups.

## Flows

```text
Intake raw file 
  -> profile & inspect 
  -> clean & normalize 
  -> produce staging import 
  -> Supabase import
```
